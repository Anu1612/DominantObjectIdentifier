# UnsplashExplorer With ML Integration
As the Name Suggest it's a Unsplash Explorer. It uses Unsplash Api to get Images from it. 
This takes the User Input in Search Bar and uses to Search Unsplash's Archive of Images. It Continously request for new Images in background. So dont have to wait for a NetworkRequest to complete and have a endless scrolling.


Shows the images in Pinterest Style format. The First Screen only shows the thumbnails of searched images
